These cells coordinate the recruitment of diverse immune cell subsets from circulation to the inflammed tissue to restrict inflammation and promote tissue repair.\n\nThe samples consist of FACS sorted cells from murine cremaster tissue under homeostasis or post-TNFa treatment at two different time points. The cells were then sequenced after cDNA libraries preparation.\n\nThe analysis shown here focuses on the decisions that were made during analysis and demonstrates a range of tools that can be used for various tasks.\n\nTo see the results of the analysis please visit the [analysis website](https://nami2309.github.io/sterile_inflammation \"Analysis website\").
